# Gugol Search Engine


_Disclaimer: While the design of the UI is clearly based on Google, this project is not for commercialization or for-profit purposes. The main purpose of the project is to understand the system of a search engine and the process behind it._

## Summary

* Created a web crawler that would go through a set of URLs and HTML content in the subdomain of ics.uci.edu.
* Constructed the inverted index by using tokenization, filters, and lemmatization of the content with NLTK.
* Applied TF-IDF, cosine similarity (vectorization), and page ranking to calculation of the final scoring of query and document terms.
* Designed a RESTful backend server to manage the requests from the front-end and adjusted results to a custom pagination method.
* Implementation of the front-end using React, JavaScript, and Material UI to create a GUI resembling Googleâ€™s approach.
* Utilized: Python, NLTK, NetworkX, Flask-RESTful, MongoDB, JavaScript, React, Axios, Material UI.

**Search Page: "Informatics Donald Bren"**
After searching for a term, the website will query and retrieve the results from the database. The interface includes a top bar or header with the logo (Clicking it will take the user back to the home page), the search bar, and a clickable search button (Magnifying glass). The result includes statistics such as the estimated number of results and the time it took to query and calculate the ranking of the search terms. Additionally, the title of the result is underlined on hover and the relevant terms in the snippet are be bolded.
