# Gugol Search Engine

_Disclaimer: While the design of the UI is clearly based on Google, this project is not for commercialization or for-profit purposes. The main purpose of the project is to understand the system of a search engine and the process behind it._

•	Created a web crawler that would go through a set of URLs and HTML content in the subdomain of ics.uci.edu.
•	Constructed the inverted index by using tokenization, filters, and lemmatization of the content with NLTK.
•	Applied TF-IDF, cosine similarity (vectorization), and page ranking to calculation of the final scoring of query and document terms.
•	Designed a RESTful backend server to manage the requests from the front-end and adjusted results to a custom pagination method.
•	Implementation of the front-end using React, JavaScript, and Material UI to create a GUI resembling Google’s approach.
•	Utilized: Python, NLTK, NetworkX, Flask-RESTful, MongoDB, JavaScript, React, Axios, Material UI.
